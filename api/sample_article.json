\"Where do animals' winter coats come from?\\nWhen it gets cold outside, you can throw on a warm jacket or coat. But have you ever wondered how animals stay warm when the seasons change?\\n\\n\"Animals pretty much have three options when it comes to the wintertime,\" said Jeannine Fleegle. She's a wildlife biologist for the Pennsylvania Game Commission. Biologists are scientists who study living things. \n\\\nOne option is that animals can leave, known as migration, Fleegle said. Migration is the movement of animals from one place to another. Migrations often happen at specific times of the year.\\\n\\\nA second option is they \"can do some sort of hibernation,\" Fleegle said. Hibernation is a biological process where an animal passes the winter in a resting state. They can do this in cozy dens or underground.\\n\\nThe third option is that \"they can stay and be active all year long,\" she said. Some animals use that third option. And for them, a change of wardrobe is in order.\\n\\nColor Change\\nMany animals change the colors of their coats when winter comes. Snowshoe hares, Arctic foxes and some weasels are examples.\\n\\nThese animals have gray or brown coats during the summer. Their coats match the surroundings in which they live. But their coats turn white when the temperature drops.\\n\\nOne reason for this color change is that in the snow, their white coats help hide them from predators. A predator is an animal that eats other animals. The white fur also helps these animals hide when they are out hunting for other critters.\\n\\nThick Underfur\\nWhite-tailed deer are found in most of the United States. These deer are reddish-brown in the summertime, said Fleegle. But when the days start getting shorter, their fur switches to a light-gray color. They do this in preparation for winter. This helps the animals blend in with their changing backgrounds. At the same time, there's a much more important shift taking place.\\n\\nDeer actually have two layers of fur, Fleegle said. The top coat is full of what scientists call guard hairs. These hairs are long and sometimes hollow. That's the fur we usually see. But beneath the top coat, there's a much thicker layer of fur called underfur. It helps keep the deer warm. \"The underfur is five times as dense as those guard hairs,\" she said.\\n\\nThe deer's underfur traps a layer of air, and that air gets warmed by the body. It's like a lining in a winter coat. \"And that's what keeps the deer warm in the wintertime,\" Fleegle said.\\n\\nWhen temperatures start warming up in the spring, the deer shed all their underfur. If they kept it, it would make them too warm.\\n\\n\"A deer's summer coat does not have underfur,\" said Fleegle. \"So there's a lot of airflow, which is basically deer air conditioning.\"\\n\\nDeer shed a lot of fur in the springtime. Look carefully and you might see clumps of it in the woods if you go for a hike.\"\\n
